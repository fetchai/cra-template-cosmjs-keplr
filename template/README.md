# Getting started

```bash
npx create-react-app --template cosmjs-keplr <destination>
cd <destination>
yarn start  # or npm start
```

# Removing the example

The example app is almost entirely contained in the `src/example` directory.
To remove the example:

- Delete the [src/example](./src/example) directory
- Remove the `@import` from [src/index.css](./src/index.css)
- Remove these lines from [public/index.html](./public/index.html):
    ```html
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script>
      tailwind.config = {
        theme: {
          extend: {
            fontFamily: {
              inter: [ "Inter", "Sans-Serif" ],
            },
          }
        }
      }
    </script>
    ```
